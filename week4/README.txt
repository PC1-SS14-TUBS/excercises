Please note that:

 - communicators.c
 - comm_broadcast.c

 Require both to request 20 processes in order for the example to work.

Also, in the case of:

 - broadcast_derived.c
 - broadcast_command.c

 Both can use any size of requested processess, although in class the examples were
 performed using 15 processes, so that the selected broadcaster were set to be the
 process with rank = 7.
